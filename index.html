        <h1 class="center">A TRIBUTE TO SOME OF THE DOCTORS WHO DIED FROM COVID-19</h1>
    </div>
    <br>
    
    <p>
        The global COVID-19 death toll stands at more than 1·3 million. Among the lives lost have been those of health-care workers, who have had crucial roles throughout the response and continue to serve at the front lines. At the outset of the pandemic, doctors warned of the potential implications of the virus. As the virus spread, many doctors provided treatment for a disease they little understood, while others contributed to accelerated research on potential treatments and vaccines. And as the COVID-19 pandemic worsened worldwide, health professionals worked tirelessly to provide care for patients—some even emerged from retirement to provide assistance. It is not possible to honour all of the health workers who have died from COVID-19, but in telling the stories of a few of the health professionals from different specialties and various countries who lost their lives to the disease, these short obituaries serve as a tribute to the many other health workers who have died in the pandemic. These lives are also a reminder of the ongoing dedication and service of those who continue to care for patients at a time when COVID-19 cases and deaths are increasing in many countries.

            <p>Salvacion Rodriguez Gatchalian, better known as Sally, knew how to disarm people. It was a skill that served her well as a paediatrician, but was even more crucial in the leadership roles she took on, including serving as President of the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society of the Philippines from 2014 to 2016 and of the Philippine Pediatric Society, beginning in 2018. “She was whip smart and a really great consensus builder”, said Edsel Salvana, the Director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the National Institutes of Health at the University of the Philippines (UP) Manila. “She was a great listener, but she was never afraid to speak up on controversial issues, even if it wasn't very popular.”Salvana grew close to Gatchalian during the controversy over the use of the dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, that erupted in 2017 in the Philippines. Gatchalian, a long-time immunisation advocate and the cofounder of the Philippine Foundation for Vaccination, was among the experts trying to rally support for vaccination, while warning that misinformation about vaccines could lead parents to avoid immunising their children altogether. “We worked together to restore vaccine confidence”, Salvana said. Even as Gatchalian squared off against former associates during the Dengvaxia debate, she was able to rebuild those relationships in its aftermath, said Lulu Bravo, a close friend and Professor Emeritus of Pediatric Infectious and Tropical Diseases at UP Manila. “She was still friendly with everyone. Although she could disagree with you, I don't think she had any enemies.”</p>

                head of the Department of
                Medicine at the All India Institute
                of Medical Science. Born on
                June 14, 1941, in Shikohabad,
                India, he died on May 23, 2020, in
                New Delhi, India, aged 78 years.</p></h3>
            <br>
            <p>Although he was a legendary
                pulmonologist, called upon to treat
                presidents and Bollywood stars,
                Jitendra Nath Pande made time for
                everyone. His office door was open to
                colleagues, students, and, especially,
                patients. “He gave a lot of time to
                patients”, said Abhishek Bhartia, the
                Director of the Sitaram Bhartia Institute
                of Science and Research in New Delhi,
                India, where Pande worked later in
                his career. “He was meticulous and he
                would never rush patients.” Instead,
                Pande used to frequently remind his
                students that patients were their best
                teachers.
                Pande was thorough in all aspects
                of his work. Early in his career on the
                faculty of the Department of Medicine
                at the All India Institute of Medical
                Science (AIIMS), he was known for
                being among the first to arrive to
                the ward each morning, a practice
                he maintained even after he became
                the head of the department. And as a
                professor, he was famous for answering
                student queries from memory with the
                page number in the textbook where
                they could find the information. “Junior
                doctors used to wait for his ward
                rounds, which were a treat to attend”,
                said Amarinder Singh Malhi, Assistant
                Professor in AIIMS’s Department
                of Cardiovascular Radiology and
                Endovascular Interventions.
                Pande earned a Bachelor of Medicine
                and Bachelor of Surgery in 1963 and
                a Doctor of Medicine in 1966, both
                from AIIMS. In 1970, he returned
                to AIIMS as an Assistant Professor,
                then served as Chief of the Division
                of Respiratory Diseases and Officer in
                Charge of the Clinical Epidemiology
                Unit, before becoming head of the
                Department of Medicine in 1993.
                His research interests included high
                altitude physiology and interstitial
                lung disease. “He was a role model for
                many students and junior faculty”,
                said Randeep Guleria, the Director of
                AIIMS. “He spent a lot of time in the
                respiratory laboratory or discussing
                research methodology with students.”
                Pande also recognised early the adverse
                effects of air pollution on people’s
                health and one of his studies was cited
                in a 1998 Supreme Court order forcing
                public transportation vehicles to switch
                from diesel to cleaner compressed
                natural gas.</p>

            <br>
            <p>There is a tradition at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Valladolid in Spain that when medical students reach the end of their studies they celebrate a last dinner with their professors. Although she had a leg injury as her class's event approached in 2015, Sara Bravo Lopez was determined to take part in the celebration. “She kept dancing all night, happy, because we were finally doctors”, said her classmate Luis Cabezudo Molleda, an internal medicine resident at the Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Palencia.After graduation, Bravo quickly found a position as a primary care doctor at the Centro de Salud de Mota del Cuervo in the province of Cuenca, Spain, and was working there when she became ill with COVID-19. It was part of her job to assess patients that came into the facility. Cheerful and indefatigable, she had a gift for soothing patients. Cabezudo said Bravo possessed that ability even in her medical school days, where she had a knack for calming her classmates before important exams. “She had the exact words that help people relax”, he said. Bravo had taken a colleague's shift and was caring for patients who came into the health centre and were later diagnosed with COVID-19, Cabezudo said. “She died because she loved her work, she did it bravely and she did it always thinking of others”, he said.One of her professors, Ignacio Rosell, an Associate Professor in the Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health at the University of Valladolid, said Bravo's fellow students and teachers “remember her as a beautiful person”, at the outset of a promising career, “always ready to collaborate and to help out”. Bravo is survived by her mother, Teresa, and her brother.</p>

                and died there on July 15, 2020,

            <p>
                Mustafa Kamal was in the midst
                of transforming Nishtar Medical
                University when he died of COVID-19.
                Named the first Vice-Chancellor when
                the university was elevated from
                a college in 2017, he was working
                to introduce new programmes at
                the institution and overseeing the
                construction of a new 500-bed
                hospital. “He was very enthusiastic to
                really improve the medical education
                and health care in that part of the
                world”, said Ghulam Qadir, a graduate
                of Nishtar and now an addiction
                psychiatry specialist, who is the CEO of
                Apex Behavioral Health in Dearborn, MI,
                USA. Qadir started working with Kamal
                a year ago to improve the psychiatric
                training at the university. “You would
                never find another person like him. If
                he promised something, he delivered.”
                Kamal remained a committed
                physician even after he was named
                Vice-Chancellor, continuing to conduct
                rounds. As COVID-19 patients began
                to arrive, “Kamal volunteered himself.
                That motivated the whole team”, said
                Sanaullah, who remained in regular
                touch with Kamal in his role as the
                President of the Nishtar Medical
                University Alumni Association of North
                America. Kamal is survived by his wife,
                Shehla, two daughters, Nabiha and
                Mahnoor, and two sons, Zain and Haris.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Livia Carrion studied medicine at the Universidad de Oriente in Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela, a school with the motto, “From the town we come and to the town we go”. She would go on to dedicate her career to providing medical services to neglected communities, often in far-flung locations. “Her sublime love and dedication to medicine and to helping the needy encouraged her to study and to work for 35 years in public health, never practising private medicine”, said her daughter Katherine Sulbaran.After receiving her medical degree in 1981, Carrion began her career in Maripa, a remote town in the centre of Venezuela, providing care to the town's residents and nearby rural communities. Her career took her back to Ciudad Bolivar, the capital of Bolivar state, but her colleagues said she remained committed to the rural communities where she spent her early years as a doctor. After she was named Director of Epidemiology of the state's Institute of Public Health in 1994, she mounted a malaria care and treatment campaign among the state's remote, Indigenous populations that served as an example of how this service should work”, said Frank Morillo, the subdirector of the epidemiology department at Ruiz y Páez University Hospital Complex in Ciudad Bolivar. She joined Morillo at Ruiz y Páez, taking over the epidemiology department in 2002. The hospital was often a centre for regional epidemic responses, including an outbreak of influenza A H1N1 that began in 2009. Together we faced the management of the H1N1 pandemic in our hospital and we handled the situation successfully. She was tireless”, Morillo said. “She always had a smile and a very good attitude”, said Oriana Urbaez, a nurse at Ruiz y Páez University Hospital Complex. “She was an example of the constant and tireless fighter against every health problem, every disease, every epidemic, every outbreak.”Although Carrion was scheduled to retire 7 years ago, she continued working in the epidemiology department because of a shortage of doctors in the state. She was at the front line of the hospital's COVID-19 response, conducting tests and organising patient admissions. She is survived by her husband, Miguel Sulbaran, and three daughters, Katherine, Nathaly, and Reyna.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Abdel-Warith received a degree in medicine and surgery from a Soviet Union university in 1974 and a master's degree in public health and epidemiology from the University of Tehran in Iran in 1978. On his return to Yemen, he was one of the only doctors with a specialisation in public health in the country, Al-Jasari said. After working briefly as the head of a rural health unit in his home region, Taiz, Abdel-Warith joined the Ministry of Health in the capital, Sana'a, where he spent decades working in various roles. “He was really a reference person for all of us”, said Al-Jasari, who worked as the head of the Ministry of Health's malaria control programme in 2004. Although Abdel-Warith was assigned to work as a monitoring and evaluation officer on HIV at the time, “when we called him or asked him to join our team or to support us, he never said no”, said Al-JasariHe also never looked for personal advancement, Al-Jasari said, instead nominating colleagues to speak to the media or to brief superiors on successes. He preferred to stay in the background, coordinating between the ministry and other agencies and quietly lobbying for his preferred strategies. His experience was considered so invaluable that even after he retired from the Ministry of Health in 2010, WHO Yemen regularly recruited him to help coordinate activities following a disease outbreak, including a key role coordinating efforts to respond to a cholera outbreak that began in 2016. “He gave to the people and the country as much as he could”, Al-Jasari said.</p>
